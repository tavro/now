        <p class="gray">This is <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">a now page</a>. If you have your own site, you should make one, too!</p>
        <p>My life is often busy, and I've been somewhat secretive when sharing details with family and friends. I thought this would be a great way to keep everyone updated on what I'm currently doing. I'll do my best to keep this page updated with any new happenings. Thank you, <a href="https://phillipridlen.com/">Phillip Ridlen</a>, for inspiring me with <a href="https://phillipridlen.com/now/">your now page</a>!</p>
        <p>This is what I'm doing as of <i><b>December 27 2024</b></i></p>

                <p>I don't have much of a life update, but as you already know, I'm moving on the 1st of January, and all my stuff is already packed. I hope my birds will enjoy their new home... :-)</p>

        <h3>Education üéì</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I've "finished" my master's thesis and am now awaiting feedback from my examiner. After that, I may need to make some revisions before I can schedule the final presentation. Besides that, I have one last exam to take in January. Hopefully, the next time you hear from me I'll have graduated!</p>
        <h3>Work üíº</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>As for work, not much has changed. I'm patiently waiting to start my role as a Developer on the Mini Pay team at <a href="https://opera.com">Opera</a>.</p>

                <p>My <a href='https://lithehax.se/'>ethical hacking organization</a> is currently on hold for the holidays. Unfortunately our collaboration with Enlightsec was canceled due to circumstances I won't go into here ‚Äî in short, they didn't secure the funding needed to move forward. On a brighter note, we're still aiming to hold the CTF event in March, though we might need to scale it down a bit. Thankfully the university and Cyberly continue to support and assist us in our efforts. We also created a mini hacking challenge for Christmas, which I'll attach here if you'd like to give it a try! We've also had a meeting with other tech related organizations at the university, where we talked about potential future collaborations. I'm optimistic that 2025 will be a great year for this organization.</p>

        <h3>Hobby Projects ‚öôÔ∏è</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>For me, having hobbies outside of studying and working is very important. My main hobbies are programming, photography, music, and writing.</p>
        <p>It's been a hectic month this month too as I've been finishing up my studies and preparing to move. On top of that, I got quite sick for a while and am still recovering.</p>

        <p>Ever since I was little I've dreamed of writing a movie script, so I've finally started working on one! It's currently around 50 pages and my goal is to double that. The project is called "The Poetry Corner: A Love Poem", and it's inspired by a "book" I wrote, which is essentially a very very long love poem. I've attempted to write movie scripts several times before but never finished them ‚Äî this time I'm determined to see it through!</p>
        <h3>Expert Progress üìà</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The concept of reaching 10,000 hours to become a professional or an expert in a field is derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a>'s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">"Outliers: The Story of Success"</a> Gladwell popularized the idea that achieving a high level of proficiency in any field typically requires about 10,000 hours of dedicated practice. This notion is based on the research of psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson">Anders Ericsson</a>, who studied the practice habits of elite performers in various domains.</p>

        <p class="gray">I've been tracking my programming time since 2019, so these numbers are based on that data. The actual total is likely higher, considering I wrote my first program in 2012! Please note that I include this jokingly; I don't necessarily believe in the idea of becoming an expert after 10,000 hours. I haven't given it much thought, and I certainly don't feel like an expert yet.</p>
