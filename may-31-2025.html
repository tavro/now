        <p>My life is often busy, and I've been somewhat secretive when sharing details with family and friends. I thought this would be a great way to keep everyone updated on what I'm currently doing. I'll do my best to keep this page updated with any new happenings. Thank you, <a href="https://phillipridlen.com/">Phillip Ridlen</a>, for inspiring me with <a href="https://phillipridlen.com/now/">your now page</a>!</p>

                <p>It has been a hectic month filled with travel. I started with a trip to Denmark, which I'll share more about further down the page. The day after I returned, I went to Stockholm, only to head back to Link√∂ping that same night. Shortly after, I traveled to Berlin to spend time with a friend who has been going through a difficult period lately. I mostly went there because I wanted to be there for her, and at the same I really enjoy her company. Despite all the exciting experiences, I can't say I'm feeling great. With summer just around the corner I expected to feel lighter but maybe all the traveling and the lack of time to just breathe are catching up with me...</p>

        <h3>Work üíº</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Things at <a href="https://opera.com/">Opera</a> still feel both fun and challenging. I'm learning something new every day. Recently I had the opportunity to attend the <a href="https://kotlinconf.com/">Kotlin Conference</a> in Copenhagen, which was enjoyable and incredibly insightful. I focused mainly on the talks about <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html">Kotlin Multiplatform</a>, and now I feel up to date with the latest developments. It's been really inspiring and I'm excited to start contributing with the knowledge I've gained.</p>
        <h3>Organizations üè¢</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>My <a href="https://lithehax.se/">ethical hacking organization</a> recently held our final event of the year, a guest lecture by fellow hacker friend and CTF player Aali. It was a great way to wrap things up. The very next day, we traveled to Stockholm to network with other ethical hackers and attend an event called <a href="https://capturetheflag.se/">CTF-Kongress</a>, an initiative aimed at connecting CTF teams on a national level. There are also some organizational changes underway. We recently held our annual meeting, where we re-elected the board. Everyone except one person was re-elected and we welcomed two new members. This year, we're aiming for clearer role definitions within the board. I'm also officially announcing the CTF Committee. This is a team of eight people who will be responsible for organizing next year's LiU CTF.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As Editor-in-Chief of <a href="https://lithanian.se">LiTHanian</a>, we're currently wrapping up the final issue of the year (for which I actually got to meet the Swedish King). And I'm happy to share that I've officially been re-elected to continue in the role for one more year. I'll be leading the work on at least four more issues of the magazine. I felt it was important to have someone in place before summer. Now that I've gained a clearer understanding of what can be improved in the organization overall, I'm excited to apply those insights moving forward. That is actually one of the main reasons I chose to run again.</p>
        <h3>Hobby Projects ‚öôÔ∏è</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>For me, having hobbies outside of studying and working is very important. My main hobbies are programming, photography, music, and writing.</p>
        <p>When it comes to programming outside of work, I haven't had much time lately. I've been focusing on my job and intentionally avoiding coding in my spare time to prevent burnout.</p>

                <p>When it comes to photography, I've managed to take a few shots while traveling and attending events. They might not be my best work, but at least it is something!</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>As for writing, I've taken a break from the novel I started a while ago and have been focusing instead on gathering and refining my English poems. I'm working on putting together a new poetry collection combined with a "photo album". Maybe I'll share a few of the better poems next month, once I've had some time to distance myself from them, haha.</p>
        <h3>Expert Progress üìà</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The concept of reaching 10,000 hours to become a professional or an expert in a field is derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a>'s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">"Outliers: The Story of Success"</a> Gladwell popularized the idea that achieving a high level of proficiency in any field typically requires about 10,000 hours of dedicated practice. This notion is based on the research of psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson">Anders Ericsson</a>, who studied the practice habits of elite performers in various domains.</p>

        <p class="gray">I've been tracking my programming time since 2019, so these numbers are based on that data. The actual total is likely higher, considering I wrote my first program in 2012! Please note that I include this jokingly; I don't necessarily believe in the idea of becoming an expert after 10,000 hours. I haven't given it much thought, and I certainly don't feel like an expert yet.</p>
