        <p>My life is often busy, and I've been somewhat secretive when sharing details with family and friends. I thought this would be a great way to keep everyone updated on what I'm currently doing. I'll do my best to keep this page updated with any new happenings. Thank you, <a href="https://phillipridlen.com/">Phillip Ridlen</a>, for inspiring me with <a href="https://phillipridlen.com/now/">your now page</a>!</p>

                <p>I've finally finished everything related to my old apartment and can now move on with my life. I went back there to dismantle my "custom-made" balcony setup (which I built so my doves could go outside without getting eaten by larger birds) and to do some cleaning. A few friends also helped me move my piano, something I'm very grateful for, as I couldn't have done it on my own. That said, I have to express my disappointment with the company that owns my previous apartment. As you may have read here before, if you've been keeping up with my now-page. It took them several months to address the flooding issue in the apartment. Just a few weeks after I moved out, my roommate had no running water at all. He had to go down five floors and out to the common area just to use the toilet or take a shower, and this went on for quite a while. When I returned the keys to their office, they claimed I was missing one. I politely explained that they had only given me two keys instead of the required three when I first moved in, and I had informed them about it at the time. They said they had noted it, but apparently, they didn't. Now, I'm being charged a few hundred dollars for the ‚Äúmissing‚Äù key. I really hope they improve their operations for the future, but I'll definitely be blacklisting them as a landlord from now on. Anyway, I'm much happier with my current landlord, even though we're only allowed two hours of laundry time per week. :-P I'm sorry if this comes off a bit negative ‚Äî I usually try to stay positive. I just use this space to vent a little.</p>

        <h3>Education üéì</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>This will be the last time you see this section on my website, because I'm officially done with my studies! (Well, almost... not all of my credits have been reported in Ladok yet.) I completed my opposition work a few days ago, and overall, it went pretty well. Since I'm not in the field of machine learning, I did my best to read up on the topic beforehand so I could give meaningful feedback on her thesis. It turns out I didn't fully grasp some aspects, and she kindly pointed out a few misunderstandings. That said, I still have some doubts about the overall approach taken to solve the problem, but hey. All in all, I'm happy for her that she's finished her master's degree, and I have to say, I was genuinely impressed by her work!</p>
        <h3>Work üíº</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>At <a href="https://opera.com/">Opera</a>, or more specifically, now that our product has its own dedicated webpage, at <a href="https://www.minipay.to/">Minipay</a>, we're officially launching our product on iOS on May 5th. It'll be exciting to see the feedback we receive from Apple users!</p>
        <p>Last month, I wrote about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Impostor Syndrome</a>. At this point, I think I've come to terms with it, though I still wouldn't say I'm ‚Äúgood‚Äù at what I do just yet, but, I can see why I'm a good fit for the team. However, right now, I'd call myself the least experienced Kotlin developer on the team ‚Äî but I'm also the newest, so that's fair. And I'm definitely contributing. Recently, I've been helping out with a React project, which is something I'm more experienced with, and it's felt good to actually be useful. That's been encouraging. I can also tell that I'm learning and improving, which is a big positive. In two weeks, the summer interns will be joining, and I asked to be a mentor, something I'm excited to say I've been approved for. I think the coming months will be really valuable for my career, and I'm looking forward to what's ahead.</p>
        <h3>Organizations üè¢</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>My <a href="https://lithehax.se/">ethical hacking organization</a> recently collaborated with a new Link√∂ping-based company called <a href="https://foocafe.org/">Foo Caf√©</a>. They've previously been active in Sk√•ne and are now looking to expand to Link√∂ping. For this event, our organization gave a lecture on the unsolved challenges from the LiU CTF, and Foo Caf√© generously provided the venue, pizza and beer, which was really nice! We're actually organizing another event with them next month (May).</p>
        <br>
        <p>As Editor-in-Chief of <a href="https://lithanian.se">LiTHanian</a>, we've been diving into old issues dating back to the early 2000s to gather material for our upcoming edition. It's been a really fascinating process. I won't spoil too much, but I can say this: we'll most likely be photographing the Swedish king for our next issue!</p>
        <h3>Hobby Projects ‚öôÔ∏è</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>For me, having hobbies outside of studying and working is very important. My main hobbies are programming, photography, music, and writing.</p>
        <p>When it comes to programming, I've actually spent quite some time researching and experimenting with <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html">Kotlin Multiplatform</a>. I'm creating an app kind of like <a href="https://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a>, but for movies, as a learning experience! The main bottleneck has been <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>; I'm not very experienced with the build system, and I still don't fully understand it. But soon enough, I think I'll be able to spend more time writing the app than debugging Gradle. Some colleagues and I also participated in <a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a> and made a web-based game about carbs. You can check it out <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/57/gnoccholini-droppotini">here</a>!</p>

                <p>In terms of photography, I've mostly been taking pictures of my friends, so nothing I'll be sharing here. I also took some photos of my old apartment that I can share. They might not be very interesting to others, though. It's also worth mentioning that I've started saving up for one of the newer Hasselblad cameras!</p>    
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>I've actually started writing again! I've been finalizing the first chapter of a book I'm currently calling <em>En K√§rleksdikt</em>. I'm revisiting a movie script I began a few months ago, as I think it would work better as a Swedish novel to start with. I still want to make a film at some point, but this feels like a better first step. I'll share a draft as soon as it's ready, just to get some reactions.</p>
        <h3>Expert Progress üìà</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The concept of reaching 10,000 hours to become a professional or an expert in a field is derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell">Malcolm Gladwell</a>'s book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)">"Outliers: The Story of Success"</a> Gladwell popularized the idea that achieving a high level of proficiency in any field typically requires about 10,000 hours of dedicated practice. This notion is based on the research of psychologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson">Anders Ericsson</a>, who studied the practice habits of elite performers in various domains.</p>

        <p class="gray">I've been tracking my programming time since 2019, so these numbers are based on that data. The actual total is likely higher, considering I wrote my first program in 2012! Please note that I include this jokingly; I don't necessarily believe in the idea of becoming an expert after 10,000 hours. I haven't given it much thought, and I certainly don't feel like an expert yet.</p>
